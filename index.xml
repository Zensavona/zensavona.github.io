      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Recently at work I have been developing a JavaScript application which talks to a JBoss (Java) based API. This application is deployed and served by JBoss and previously the way I was doing development was having a &lt;code&gt;webpack&lt;/code&gt; watch script with &lt;code&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, and then &lt;code&gt;rsync&lt;/code&gt; the built files to the directory the Java server serves them from. This is mostly because of CORS and JBoss SSO only working for specific domains (and by extension, ports).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I realised that I can actually improve my workflow significantly with HMR (Hot Module Reloading) and that it is totally possible to do without using node to serve your &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; (or anything).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ok-so-how-do-we-do-it&#34;&gt;Ok, so how do we do it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up you&amp;rsquo;ll need different &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; files to host your JS code for development and production. This is true for any HMR setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#combining-with-an-existing-server&#34;&gt;relevant section of the Webpack docs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this is basically telling us, is that normally &lt;code&gt;webpack-dev-server&lt;/code&gt; serves both the inital &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file with a link to a url which serves the hot loaded code, and the actual code as we change it. These are by default served on ports 8080 and 9090. What we want to do is half of that. We still want to serve the hot loaded code, but not the &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; as we will serve that ourselves with our own webserver (in my case JBoss).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide assumes you have a basic &lt;code&gt;webpack 1.x&lt;/code&gt; setup already going. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, you can refer to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.tamizhvendan.in/blog/2015/11/23/a-beginner-guide-to-setup-react-dot-js-environment-using-babel-6-and-webpack/&#34;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;installing-dependencies&#34;&gt;Installing dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to install (if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have them) &lt;code&gt;html-webpack-plugin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;webpack-dev-middleware&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;webpack-dev-server&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;webpack-hot-middleware&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;url-loader&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;style-loader&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;file-loader&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can just run &lt;code&gt;npm install --save-dev webpack-hot-middleware webpack-dev-server webpack-dev-middleware html-webpack-plugin style-loader file-loader url-loader&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;webpack-config&#34;&gt;Webpack Config&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we&amp;rsquo;ll update our &lt;code&gt;webpack.conf.js&lt;/code&gt; to run the dev server and do HMR!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a simple example of a &lt;code&gt;webpack.conf.js&lt;/code&gt;, you can copy and paste bits that look different into your own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This configuration makes a few assumptions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your built files will be output to &lt;code&gt;dist/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your source files live in &lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your application entrypoint is &lt;code&gt;src/main.{js, jsx}&lt;/code&gt; (can have either js or jsx extension)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There exists a file in the same folder as this config file called &lt;code&gt;index.ejs&lt;/code&gt; (we&amp;rsquo;ll get to this in just a sec)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var webpack = require(&#39;webpack&#39;);
var path = require(&#39;path&#39;);
var HtmlWebpackPlugin = require(&#39;html-webpack-plugin&#39;);

var BUILD_DIR = path.resolve(__dirname, &#39;dist&#39;);
var APP_DIR = path.resolve(__dirname, &#39;src&#39;);

var config = {
  devtool: &#39;eval&#39;,
  entry: [
    &amp;quot;webpack-dev-server/client?http://localhost:9090&amp;quot;,
    &amp;quot;webpack/hot/only-dev-server&amp;quot;,
    &#39;babel-polyfill&#39;,
    APP_DIR + &#39;/main&#39;
  ],
  output: {
    path: BUILD_DIR,
    filename: &#39;bundle.js&#39;,
    publicPath: &amp;quot;http://localhost:9090/&amp;quot;
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.HotModuleReplacementPlugin(),
    new webpack.NoErrorsPlugin(),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: &#39;index.ejs&#39;
    })
  ],
  devServer: { inline: true },
  module : {
    loaders : [
      {
        test : /\.jsx?$/,
        include : APP_DIR,
        loaders : [&#39;react-hot&#39;, &#39;babel&#39;]
      },
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        loader: &#39;style!css?sourceMap&#39;
      }, {
        test: /\.woff(\?v=\d+\.\d+\.\d+)?$/,
        loader: &amp;quot;url?limit=10000&amp;amp;mimetype=application/font-woff&amp;quot;
      }, {
        test: /\.woff2(\?v=\d+\.\d+\.\d+)?$/,
        loader: &amp;quot;url?limit=10000&amp;amp;mimetype=application/font-woff&amp;quot;
      }, {
        test: /\.ttf(\?v=\d+\.\d+\.\d+)?$/,
        loader: &amp;quot;url?limit=10000&amp;amp;mimetype=application/octet-stream&amp;quot;
      }, {
        test: /\.eot(\?v=\d+\.\d+\.\d+)?$/,
        loader: &amp;quot;file&amp;quot;
      }, {
        test: /\.svg(\?v=\d+\.\d+\.\d+)?$/,
        loader: &amp;quot;url?limit=10000&amp;amp;mimetype=image/svg+xml&amp;quot;
      }
    ]
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [&#39;&#39;, &#39;.js&#39;, &#39;.jsx&#39;, &#39;.css&#39;]
  }
};

module.exports = config;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;index-ejs&#34;&gt;index.ejs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is basically a template &lt;code&gt;webpack&lt;/code&gt; uses to inject the markup required for hot loading. It is basically just a html file (it can &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#configuration&#34;&gt;output some variables&lt;/a&gt;) which serves your bundle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta charset=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;My Application&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;viewport&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;!-- imported CSS are concatenated and added automatically --&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;div id=&amp;quot;app&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-hmr-server&#34;&gt;The HMR Server&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to install express (&lt;code&gt;npm install --save-dev express&lt;/code&gt;) and create a file called &lt;code&gt;server.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this does is actually serve the bundled file for &lt;code&gt;webpack-dev-server&lt;/code&gt; to send through to the page every time we make a change. I also have mine serve a &lt;code&gt;style.css&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;var express = require(&#39;express&#39;);
var app = express();

// Serve application file
app.get(&#39;/bundle.js&#39;, function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + &#39;/dist/bundle.js&#39;);
});

// Serve aggregate stylesheet
app.get(&#39;/style.css&#39;, function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + &#39;/build/style.css&#39;);
});

app.use(express.static(&#39;dev-public&#39;));


// Serve index page
app.get(&#39;*&#39;, function(req, res) {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + &#39;/dist/index.html&#39;);
});

if (!process.env.PRODUCTION) {
  var webpack = require(&#39;webpack&#39;);
  var WebpackDevServer = require(&#39;webpack-dev-server&#39;);
  var config = require(&#39;./webpack.config&#39;);

  new WebpackDevServer(webpack(config), {
    publicPath: config.output.publicPath,
    hot: true,
    noInfo: true,
    historyApiFallback: true
  }).listen(9090, &#39;localhost&#39;, function (err, result) {
    if (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }
  });
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;npm-script-starting-things-up&#34;&gt;NPM Script &amp;amp; Starting Things Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s make a new entry in the &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; section of our &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;server&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;webpack --progress -p &amp;amp;&amp;amp; node server.js&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;npm run server&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, we need to copy the &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file from our &lt;code&gt;dist/&lt;/code&gt; directory to wherever the webserver (in my case, JBoss) is looking for it. This could be in a &lt;code&gt;.war/&lt;/code&gt; folder/file somewhere on your filesystem. This method works for pretty much any kind of webserver!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me know in the comments below if this worked for you, or if you need any more help with it!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Aurelia and Redux together for good times all around</title>
      <link>https://zen.id.au/using-aurelia-and-redux-together-for-good-times-all-around</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2016 12:46:52 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zen.id.au/using-aurelia-and-redux-together-for-good-times-all-around</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since playing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://facebook.github.io/react/&#34;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://redux.js.org/&#34;&gt;Redux&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve really missed the separation of data flow and view logic this affords when working with &lt;a href=&#34;https://aurelia.io/&#34;&gt;Aurelia&lt;/a&gt; - in my opinion a fantastic framework to work with, but lacks data management features out-of-the-box. But alas, Redux to the rescue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m going to show you how to use Redux with Aurelia in a pretty simple example with config for &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en&#34;&gt;Redux Chrome DevTools&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/fcomb/redux-logger&#34;&gt;redux-logger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk&#34;&gt;redux-thunk&lt;/a&gt;. Basically we&#39;re going to create a store and DI it everywhere, just like how in a React app you&#39;d inject it through the router or create some kind of global. This assumes basic familiarity with Redux and Aurelia and the code can be found &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&#39;s install all the bits we need:  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;npm install --save redux redux-logger redux-thunk
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW I am using: &lt;br /&gt;
aurelia-* beta 1 &lt;br /&gt;
redux 3.3.1 &lt;br /&gt;
redux-logger 2.6.1 &lt;br /&gt;
redux-thunk 2.0.1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nice, now let&#39;s make a new file called &lt;code&gt;store.js&lt;/code&gt; and put all our Redux code there. Normally I like to make a folder for all of this and break it up, but for the purpose of this example we&#39;ll keep it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code data-language=&#34;js&#34;&gt;import { createStore, applyMiddleware, compose } from &#39;redux&#39;
import thunkMiddleware from &#39;redux-thunk&#39;
import createLogger from &#39;redux-logger&#39;

const loggerMiddleware = createLogger();

const sessionReducer = (state = {
  error: null,
  loggedIn: false
}, action) =&gt; {
  switch (action.type) {
    case &#39;LOGIN_SUCCESS&#39;:
      return {
        ...state,
        loggedIn: true,
        error: null
      };
    case &#39;LOGIN_FAILURE&#39;:
      return {
        ...state,
        loggedIn: false,
        error: action.error
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

function configureStore() {
  return createStore(
    sessionReducer, // or combine some reducers
    compose(
      applyMiddleware(
        thunkMiddleware,
        loggerMiddleware
      ),
      window.devToolsExtension ? window.devToolsExtension() : undefined
    )
  )
}

export const reduxStore = configureStore();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s go over to our &lt;code&gt;app.js&lt;/code&gt; (or whatever your root ViewModel is) and DI it in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;code data-language=&#34;js&#34;&gt;import {inject} from &#39;aurelia-framework&#39;;
import {reduxStore} from &#39;store&#39;;

@inject(reduxStore)
export class App {
  constructor(store) {
    this.store = store;
    this.store.dispatch({type: &#39;LOGIN_FAILURE&#39;, error: &#39;Oops! Wrong password matey.&#39;});
  }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we&#39;re Dependency Injecting the store with &lt;code&gt;@inject&lt;/code&gt;, we can do this in many different ViewModels and know we&#39;re getting the same instance everywhere, meaning we can just &lt;code&gt;store.subscribe()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;store.dispatcher.dispatch()&lt;/code&gt; in many places and know everything is talking to the same &lt;code&gt;store&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you found this easy to follow or have any questions, I&#39;ve only recently started writing these kinds of quick tip blog posts!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Make The Elixir Shell (IEX) Save History</title>
      <link>https://zen.id.au/how-to-make-the-elixir-shell-iex-save-history</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 14 Nov 2015 12:46:52 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zen.id.au/how-to-make-the-elixir-shell-iex-save-history</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve ever used &lt;code&gt;irb&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;node&lt;/code&gt; or pretty much any other command line REPL, you probably really miss being able to use the up and down keys to recall your last commands from a previous session in &lt;code&gt;iex&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ferd/erlang-history&#34;&gt;a package&lt;/a&gt; which hacks this functionality into the Erlang shell, and thus also works for Elixir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s very simple to install:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone git@github.com:ferd/erlang-history.git  
cd erlang-history  
make install  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that you may need to run the last line as &lt;code&gt;sudo make install&lt;/code&gt; depending how and where you installed Erlang/Elixir. I needed to do this, and I installed Erlang with Homebrew on OS X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Make Developers Like You (For Recruiters)</title>
      <link>https://zen.id.au/how-to-make-developers-like-you-for-recruiters</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2015 12:46:52 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zen.id.au/how-to-make-developers-like-you-for-recruiters</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think most software engineers know what I&#39;m talking about when I say &#34;recruiters are annoying&#34;. We all get the tweets and emails that are like &#34;Hey, I saw your GitHub/LinkedIn/Twitter/Blog and have a great opportunity for you, can we set up a Skype/phone conversation?&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you reply with a question about tech stack and pay, often their response will be something like &#34;let&#39;s talk about it over the phone&#34; or they will tell you and it will be something completely unrelated to what you do (which they&#39;d know if they actually saw your GitHub or LinkedIn).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve had the &#34;why do they do this? surely it doesn&#39;t work&#34; question in the back of my mind for a few years now, but reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ionutRR&#34;&gt;Ionut Roghina&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s great &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@ionutroghina/what-s-the-deal-with-it-recruitment-agencies-9d10a75335bc#.mce3txti8&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about recruitment agencies actually made me write this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they simply don&#39;t know that they&#39;re doing it wrong? Maybe they aren&#39;t aware of what we (developers, and people in the tech industry) want, and how to please us? It&#39;s the only logical conclusion I can come to, given that jobs in the industry are very much a &#34;seller&#39;s market&#34; for anyone even vaguely worth hiring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: I am not looking for work, please don&#39;t take this as a request for job offers...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here is my easy 3 step guide for recruiters to get the attention of 100% of potential developers who might be interested in a new gig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step1takeaquicklookatmygithuborlinkedinpage&#34;&gt;Step 1: Take a quick look at my GitHub or LinkedIn page&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re looking for a senior systems developer with Golang and MongoDB experience, do I have any references to these technologies or similar ones?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you answered yes to this question, proceed to step 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step2tellmewhatyouareoffering&#34;&gt;Step 2: Tell me what you are offering&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweet or email is fine, a tweet is probably more likely to get my attention, but it must communicate to me that you have not skipped step 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have a Sr. Systems Eng. (Go/Mongo) position available, interested? DM me 😎&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short tweet, you&#39;ve demonstrated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&#39;ve seen that I have some experience or interest in Golang or MongoDB&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You know something about these technologies, as you have abbreviated them to their colloquial names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You use emojis, which is a good indicator that you understand the format of the platform we&#39;re communicating on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not so hard, was it? If I reply/DM, continue to step 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;step3answermyquestionswithoutrigmarole&#34;&gt;Step 3: Answer my questions without rigmarole&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&#39;m looking for a new job and what you&#39;ve got is something I am qualified for and/or interested in, I&#39;ll probably send you a DM/email reply right about now, and it will probably go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hey [you], can you tell me some more about that Go/Mongo position? &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;ve got this far, it&#39;s easy, all you need to do is not scare me away. If you&#39;re finding that you lose a lot of potential recruits at this stage or the next one, you&#39;re probably doing this bit wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your reply should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me some more details about what the position entails (Is it an education startup? Enterprise accounting software? Telecommunications? Facebook For Cats?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me how much money is on offer&lt;/strong&gt;, even if it&#39;s a pay range like &#34;$90-110k&#34;, that&#39;s fine. But please, don&#39;t say &#34;negotiable based on experience&#34; or &#34;market salary&#34;. That doesn&#39;t mean anything. The variance in salary within my own personal network for the job I personally do is upwards of $100k. I think it&#39;s pretty rude to ask me to give you 30mins to an hour of my time for a phone interview before you even tell me this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell me a bit about the company, the location and if remote work is offered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hi Zen,
  The position is at a social media startup in Berlin. Your role would be to provide design guidance for our backend team and help scale it moving forward. Remote work is possible but we like to have at least 4 hours of timezone overlap and would prefer someone based in the area. The salary is €80-€110k depending on experience, but negotiable for the right candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If this sounds good to you, or you&#39;d like to know more, you can call me on [number] or Skype me at [skype name].&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Best,&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Name&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the person actually wants to find new work, and is interested in what you have to offer, I would be very surprised if you don&#39;t get a positive response to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main takeaways here: developers don&#39;t need you, and developers are used to recruiters being pests. &lt;strong&gt;This isn&#39;t a bad thing for you&lt;/strong&gt;, in fact it means that if you clearly demonstrate that you &#34;get it&#34;, you will win their favour very easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely believe that if you spend an hour doing this process for 50 developers, you will get more (and higher quality) leads than sending 1000 carbon copy emails or tweets, so take from that what you will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Parallelise external API calls with Elixir to make them super fast</title>
      <link>https://zen.id.au/parallelise-external-api-calls-with-elixir-to-make-them-super-fast</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2015 12:46:52 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zen.id.au/parallelise-external-api-calls-with-elixir-to-make-them-super-fast</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m working on a Phoenix application which uses the Instagram API via the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zensavona/elixtagram&#34;&gt;Elixtagram library&lt;/a&gt;. There is a particular page where I need to display a bunch of users who need to be retrieved from the API... Here&#39;s the &#34;before&#34; (sequential) code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def users_list(%Account{favourite_users: users}) do  
  Elixtagram.configure
  users
  |&amp;gt; Enum.map(fn(u) -&amp;gt; Elixtagram.user(u.ig_id).username end)
  |&amp;gt; Enum.join(&#34;, &#34;)
end  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&#39;m doing here is simply passing in a list of Instagram IDs and returning a string of comma separated usernames. The obvious problem here is that Elixtagram is making an API call which can take some relatively large amount of milliseconds, and it&#39;s silly to wait for each one to finish before starting the next one, especially when we&#39;re using a language with such easily accessible concurrency as Elixir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s the &#34;fixed&#34; code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def users_list(%Account{favourite_users: users}) do  
  Elixtagram.configure
  users
  |&amp;gt; Enum.map(fn(u) -&amp;gt; Task.async(fn -&amp;gt; Elixtagram.user(u.ig_id).username end) end)
  |&amp;gt; Enum.map(&amp;amp;Task.await/1)
  |&amp;gt; Enum.join(&#34;, &#34;)
end  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference here is that instead of blocking for each request in the &lt;code&gt;Enum.map&lt;/code&gt;, I&#39;m filling the list up with async tasks, which I then wait for on the next line. What this means is that the amount of requests we make here has little impact on the performance of the code (until we saturate the network...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck with your concurrency adventures, friends!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>I have impacted the lives of 87k developers</title>

      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jun 2015 12:46:52 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zen.id.au/i-have-impacted-the-lives-of-87k-developers</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was looking at my StackOverflow profile the other day and saw something that made me stop and think for a second:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zenidau.s3.amazonaws.com/2015/Jun/Screenshot_2015_06_26_20_36_16-1435497582888.png&#34; alt=&#34;StackOverflow profile&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am by no means a high reputation user, or someone who participates in SO very often but wow, that number is absolutely mind bending to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I understand this to mean is that eighty seven thousand developers have read the words I wrote after probably googling something related to a problem they&#39;ve had. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve spoken to even one percent of that number of people face to face over the course of my entire life so far. It&#39;s nuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funniest part is that most of the views my Qs and As have received are from questions about &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5346787/clearing-check-boxes-in-vb-net&#34;&gt;.NET from my first semester of university&lt;/a&gt; or my &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12830095/setting-http-headers-in-golang&#34;&gt;first week of learning Go&lt;/a&gt;. I guess we all get stuck on similar issues when we&#39;re starting out, before we go down our respective tech stack specialisation rabbit holes...&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Manage Multiple Domains &amp; Subdomains with Rails 4 on Heroku</title>
      <link>https://zen.id.au/how-to-manage-multiple-domains--subdomains-with-rails-4-on-heroku</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2015 12:46:52 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zen.id.au/how-to-manage-multiple-domains--subdomains-with-rails-4-on-heroku</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently I&#39;ve been working on a multi-tenant blog hosting application with a Rails front end, and this required us to let users set their own domains. Here&#39;s how to dynamically route your Rails application with multiple domains and subdomains (of yours and theirs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;dynamicroutinginrails&#34;&gt;Dynamic routing in Rails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my application there is the concept of a &lt;code&gt;Site&lt;/code&gt; which always has a &lt;code&gt;slug&lt;/code&gt;, which becomes &lt;code&gt;slug.mydomain.com&lt;/code&gt;. And sometimes has a &lt;code&gt;domain&lt;/code&gt;, which belongs to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to do is match the request based on a &lt;code&gt;constraint&lt;/code&gt; which is simply a class we create, which implements the &lt;code&gt;matches?&lt;/code&gt; method. This is very simple as you will see below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;routes.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;...
class CustomDomainConstraint  
  # Implement the .matches? method and pass in the request object
  def self.matches? request
    matching_site?(request)
  end

  def self.matching_site? request
    # handle the case of the user&#39;s domain being either www. or a root domain with one query
    if request.subdomain == &#39;www&#39;
      req = request.host[4..-1]
    else
      req = request.host
    end

    # first test if there exists a Site with a domain which matches the request,
    # if not, check the subdomain. If none are found, the the &#39;match&#39; will not match anything
    Site.where(:domain =&amp;gt; req).any? || Site.where(:slug =&amp;gt; request.subdomain).any?
  end
end

match &#39;/&#39;, :to =&amp;gt; &#39;sites#index&#39;, :constraints =&amp;gt; CustomDomainConstraint, via: :all  
match &#39;/category/:slug&#39; =&amp;gt; &#39;sites#category&#39;, :constraints =&amp;gt; CustomDomainConstraint, via: :all  
match &#39;/:slug&#39;, to: &#39;sites#show&#39;, :constraints =&amp;gt; CustomDomainConstraint, via: :all  
...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s worth noting here that if your app allows users to specify their own domains, you should have a system of blacklisting your own domain/s and the &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; subdomain/slug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then all I need to do in the &lt;code&gt;sites_controller.rb&lt;/code&gt; is implement a &lt;code&gt;before_filter&lt;/code&gt; which finds the &lt;code&gt;Site&lt;/code&gt; based on some request data, this is the code I used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;before_filter :find_site

...

private

  def find_site
    # generalise away the potential www. or root variants of the domain name
    if request.subdomain == &#39;www&#39;
      req = request.host[4..-1]
    else
      req = request.host
    end

    # first test if there exists a Site with the requested domain,
    # then check if it&#39;s a subdomain of the application&#39;s main domain
    @site = Site.find_by(domain: req) || Site.find_by(slug: request.subdomain)

    # if a matching site wasn&#39;t found, redirect the user to the www.&amp;lt;root url&amp;gt;
    redirect_to root_url(subdomain: &#39;www&#39;) unless @site
  end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;pointingdomainsandsubdomainstoyourrailsapplication&#34;&gt;Pointing Domains And Subdomains To Your Rails Application&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need to do, or have your users do is &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; their domain name to your main domain which points to your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;multipledomainsonherokuwithrails&#34;&gt;Multiple Domains On Heroku With Rails&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My application lives on Heroku, and they use virtual hosts to route domain names, this means we need to tell them when we want to &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; a new domain to our instance.  To do this I just implemented an &lt;code&gt;after_save&lt;/code&gt; on my &lt;code&gt;Site&lt;/code&gt; model which uses Heroku&#39;s API to register a new domain with my application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;site.rb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;after_save do |site|  
  heroku_environments = %w(production staging)
  if site.domain &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (heroku_environments.include? Rails.env)
    added = false
    heroku = Heroku::API.new(api_key: ENV[&#39;HEROKU_API_KEY&#39;])
    heroku.get_domains(ENV[&#39;APP_NAME&#39;]).data[:body].each do |domain|
      added = true if domain[&#39;domain&#39;] == site.domain
    end

    unless added
      heroku.post_domain(ENV[&#39;APP_NAME&#39;], site.domain)
      heroku.post_domain(ENV[&#39;APP_NAME&#39;], &#34;www.#{site.domain}&#34;)
    end
  end
end  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was looking around the internet for a while before I figured out how to do this, so I hope this makes your day easier :) Comment below or tweet me if you have any questions or suggestions!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anomie</title>
      <link>https://zen.id.au/anomie</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2015 12:46:52 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zen.id.au/anomie</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Anomie is the condition of a society in which there are no clear rules, norms or standards of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern western society we seem to triumph diversity and inclusiveness over all else. I think this is misguided and wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to draw a line here between demographic and moral diversity, demographic diversity (skin colour, age, sex, sexual orientation, etc.) is surely a good thing for the majority of the population; unfortunately we are not making this  distinction - our society, or at least the political left, promotes the idea that &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; should be diverse and inclusive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you make this distinction you see that nobody can coherently even &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; moral diversity - if you are for the issue of gay marriage, would you prefer there to be a great variety of opinions and no dominant one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A happy society depends on people seeing the world the same way, and for people to see the world the same way they must share a morality. What this means in a practical sense is that allowing society to have pockets of various cultures, be them ethnographic, ideological or religious, goes against the ideal of fostering a sense of oneness in that society. A common morality and culture must be agreed upon and fostered by all, or it becomes easy to divide a group of people into hostile factions based on small differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically what I’m euphemising is that Islam, Christianity, (modern) Feminism and their siblings all have to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chiang Mai</title>
      <link>https://zen.id.au/chiang-mai</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2015 12:46:52 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zen.id.au/chiang-mai</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chiang Mai is a beautiful city with an attitude to match.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my third time in Chiang Mai, Thailand; it&#39;s taken me a combined 6 months or so of time spent here to actually pen a post about it. I haven&#39;t quite had the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chiang Mai is the second biggest city in Thailand and completely different to Bangkok, it&#39;s chilled out, green, hipster and full of lovely locals and foreigners. You don&#39;t get harassed on the street to buy a tailored suit or to get in a tuktuk ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had quite an (unfortunately) bad opinion of Thailand until coming up north, I had only really seen Bangkok and touristy areas in the south, and the attitudes presented by Thais in those places. This was almost immediately dispelled when I arrived here in Chiang Mai - I have a really vivid memory of stopping by a small watch shop on one of my first nights here asking for directions to the night market, I was completely lost and in the wrong part of town and the man I was speaking to couldn&#39;t quite figure out a way of directing me in English to the place I needed to go. His solution was to say &#34;follow me!&#34; and take me the ~15min ride to the market on his scooter with me riding behind him. When we got there he just smiled and waved me off. This experience really stuck with me and it really summarises the feel of the place: warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;banlilah&#34;&gt;Banlilah&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ever go to Chiang Mai, my advice is to stay here. It&#39;s the first place I stayed when I moved here for 5 months last year and the place has an amazing feeling to it. The two ladies who run the place were super nice to me and even helped me find an apartment to live. Every time I&#39;m back here I stay here and recommend it to my friends. It&#39;s in a fantastic location outside of the old city and near a local food market, &lt;strong&gt;they also have a cat cafe&lt;/strong&gt; which is as cool as it sounds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/97223087/m=900/f67fc3b8c3b22efb3d525a4f403c8ddf&#34; alt=&#34;One Fine Pussycat&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;food&#34;&gt;Food&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The food in this city is some of the best I&#39;ve seen anywhere in the world. I love eating so this is important to me. There&#39;s super yummy and cheap local food markets with Thai food and at least one good restaurant serving pretty much everything else I can think of. There are a number of delicious Mexican and Japanese restaurants which I frequent...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/97201807/m=900/3be2cd9f79c3cfc652d0882815004ef7&#34; alt=&#34;Chicken Noodle Soup&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://drscdn.500px.org/photo/97201805/m=900/b7eee8705b0561eb5de2b7b8cffc5c87&#34; alt=&#34;Froyo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically Chiang Mai is really cool and I will definitely spend a lot more time here in the future. Definitely my favourite city in S. E. Asia thus far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first impressions of Belgium were of Gent, a small student city to the west of Brussels, since then I&#39;ve been staying in Brussels with my friend Anna and her cat Hera; this has widened my perspective of Belgium and the people who live here in the best possible way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://31.media.tumblr.com/5b78d66bd51e9a2c4291a64402132802/tumblr_inline_n8vkbfV5Xk1satkej.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Hera the cat&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I realised when I explored this city for the day was that Brussels is exactly as it seems. What I mean is that people and places are not coloured in a certain light, they are not fake and they are exactly as they are. The junkies who shoot up heroin do so in the park and aren&#39;t ashamed of their nature, the young (and old) who dance to 50&#39;s tunes at Mémé Moustache are drunk on delicious 10% beer and don&#39;t worry about the fact, there is no conformist culture of fashion in the way I&#39;ve seen it before. Individuality is accepted and encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brussels is safe but not cushy, clean but not tidy and beautiful but not pretty. The more I see the more I love of this wonderful country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belgium is unreal. I&#39;ve been in Gent for two days now and I love it here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Belgium is the first country I&#39;ve ever visited that completely just &#39;gets it&#39;. They don&#39;t have tons of health and safety bullshit, but nobody is stupid - they seem to favour individual liberty and trust people to not be stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The people are friendly and welcoming, their country appears like it&#39;s being taken care of by a government that actually cares, there is greenery everywhere, a scandinavian-esque kind of style set against a backdrop of illustrious castles and cathedrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, yesterday I was walking down the street and there were some workers installing some kind of poster or something on a high wall with a small cherry-picker. In Australia we would have seven guys in high visibility vests, 6 red barricades, the street would be closed and there would be two warning signs so you are still safe (and they aren&#39;t liable) if you miss the first. Was there any of that here? Nope. Everyone made their way past it, nobody walked close enough to put themselves in danger and parents kept their children from playing with anything they shouldn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing which surprised me is that trams run on the road alongside cars and everyone shares the same space (even bicycles). No cyclists seem phased by the trams, they just keep out of the way and get on with their business. If they are in the way, the tram driver has a dinky little bell she can ring at you if you are blocking her way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are still very fresh impressions, but I like to try to capture my feelings about a place before I normalise and become used to it. Tonight we will see what Brussels has to offer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Feeling understood</title>
      <link>https://zen.id.au/feeling-understood</link>

      <guid>https://zen.id.au/feeling-understood</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, communicating and feeling understood is one of the most pleasurable and rewarding things I can do with my time. It&#39;s unfortunate that I&#39;ve met only a handful of people in my life that I can feel this way when talking with. This is the criteria I tend to use when judging the closeness of my friends and the intimacy of a relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something I have recently discovered is that my perception of someone else&#39;s understanding of me is often wrong, and being understood does not always mean feeling understood. For example, there is a person I know whom I often don&#39;t give enough credit for her understanding of what I say and the meaning of my behaviour - yet she constantly surprises me with the insight she has to why I do and say what I do. Understanding this mechanism is great, it let&#39;s me put the people I know into distinct groups: people I feel to understand me, and people I don&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I term &#34;being understood&#34; is really the feeling I get when I can verbalise raw thought and the other person will &#39;just get&#39; the context and what lead me to say that - that &#39;click&#39; when thought is transferred in as explicit a manner as possible with language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about this kind of interaction is the freedom of expression it allows, there are no taboos or things you need to avoid in fear of being &#39;taken the wrong way&#39;. This feels comfortable and even the presence of a person like this improves my mood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;whattotakefromthis&#34;&gt;What to take from this?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I optimise for being understood? Is doing this something I even want to do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to manipulate my perception and feel understood by those who do understand me but I don&#39;t feel understood by?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the mechanism which drives the &#39;click&#39; feeling of interaction with someone like this and what specifically triggers it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have any thoughts on this, email me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Github for government</title>
      <link>https://zen.id.au/github-for-government</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2013 12:46:52 +1100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://zen.id.au/github-for-government</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of both &lt;a href=&#39;http://git-scm.com/&#39;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#39;http://github.com/&#39;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; (both as a product and as a company - it&amp;#8217;s made by a bunch of seriously cool people) and I think that a thing like Github is (with a few pretty minor tweaks) what we need to bring our 19th century governments into the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#39;our_popular_democratic_government_systems_are_fundamentally_broken_by_design&#39;&gt;Our popular democratic government systems are fundamentally broken by design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me prefix this: I am Australian and live in Australia, I understand that most of the people reading this will be in America and maybe Europe, so let&amp;#8217;s not argue over details but look at the ideas most of the world&amp;#8217;s democratic government systems are based upon - they are all pretty similar in concept. My understanding of the way even our government works is quite limited, but I will do my best to present my ideas - if I am erroneous please let me know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that representative government is designed to solve the following problem: &lt;em&gt;people have different views and beliefs; in order to develop policies which best represent the group as a whole, we elect people whom we believe best echo our views and interests to represent us in the creation and uphold of laws.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, everyone should be able to represent their own unique views on every issue individually. When you have 21 million people who each have slightly differing views on issues, this becomes difficult for a couple of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you tried to put all those people in a room and consider every single opinion, it would take so long that nothing would get done&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Not everyone has the time to go sit in a room arguing about laws all the time, and it seems unfair that a person shouldn&amp;#8217;t have their view/s represented because they don&amp;#8217;t have time to argue it &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These are legitimate problems and it seems this is the reason our current models of government have stuck around so long. Although our present government models kind of work, there are some serious issues: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;When you elect an &lt;em&gt;individual&lt;/em&gt; to represent your interests, they are always going to have their own interests as well. It&amp;#8217;s human nature to put your own interests first and until the human mind completely changes corruption and self serving lawmaking is always going to be an issue.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Because of the amount of interaction, voting parties and the general inefficiency of the whole system, the time frame from realising a change needs to be made (even if the majority agrees on this) and actually applying a real law is sometimes many years.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The process for an individual to propose a change to the law and actually have that suggestion heard is often long, unclear and off-putting unless they are already heavily involved in politics.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Running a system of parliament and employing all the people needed to make such a system work in hugely expensive and resource hungry.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The amount of formal and informal education required to even think about contributing to politics is extremely prohibitive to &amp;#8216;normal people&amp;#8217;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#39;github_for_government&#39;&gt;Github for government&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that the technology we have right now (computers, smartphones, widespread availability of internet) could solve most of these problems and provide a much better system. Admittedly I haven&amp;#8217;t considered a lot of details - but I&amp;#8217;d like to present the basic idea and get some feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I propose is a Github-esque system of collaborative document editing/versioning/merging for legal documents and laws. Imagine how unimaginably fucking fantastic it would be if I as a regular dude could go fork some law, change some things around, make a pull request and if approved by a group of maintainers (not sure how these people would be elected? Perhaps the whole thing would need a reputation based moderation system a la &lt;a href=&#39;http://stackoverflow.com/&#39;&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt;?) be voted on by the general public. I think that would be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#39;what_this_would_mean_for_government_as_we_know_it&#39;&gt;What this would mean for government as we know it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our whole system of party politics could be thrown out, and with it all the bias and relationship bullshit that comes with it. Everyone could vote on and discuss individual, modular issues which are completely separate to each other - it seems obvious that government should be done this way. Why do I need to agree with &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; some particular politician thinks? What if one person represents my views relating to education and health, but I completely disagree with their policy regarding same sex marriage and the environment? Why can&amp;#8217;t I have the best of all the opinions across all members of all parties? Why do we even have parties if such a collaborative, distributed, modular approach to government is possible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#39;everyone_can_participate&#39;&gt;Everyone can participate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to implement such a system, those with smartphones could download a Government app and receive notifications when there is a new proposed change to vote on. If they don&amp;#8217;t particularly care about certain issues, they could choose to &amp;#8216;follow&amp;#8217; certain &amp;#8216;repositories&amp;#8217; of laws. Those without smartphones could receive an email notifying them that there is a new change to vote on. There would probably need to be some amount of buffer time between proposing a law change and deciding that it&amp;#8217;s agreed upon (maybe something like 30-45 days could be allowed to give everyone time to review changes and check their email), but I don&amp;#8217;t think every single person should necessarily have to vote on every single issue - you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be forced to make a decision on something you don&amp;#8217;t care about or know enough about to feel you can make educated judgement. There should certainly be a minimum number (somewhat like the Whitehouse&amp;#8217;s threshold for proposals to be reviewed, maybe there would be some kind of minimum stars or votes for a pull-request to be reviewed and go to a public vote for approval? Just thinking aloud here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There could be a global changelog on the homepage, showing all the changes in chronological order, people could subscribe to notifications and be alerted when this changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#39;lets_do_it&#39;&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s do it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that ripping the current government system out by the roots sounds crazy and impossible, but throughout history bigger changes have happened. I think there would be an incredible amount of public support for something like this if there is a way of explaining this system to regular people and educating them as to how it could benefit them. It certainly needs a whole lot more thought and detail, and if you have any ideas, thoughts or feedback (positive or negative) I would love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Trust</title>
      <link>https://zen.id.au/on-trust</link>

      <guid>https://zen.id.au/on-trust</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, this seems obvious - but I think all real realisations are that way, aren&amp;#8217;t they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been told by many people throughout my life to &amp;#8220;only ever trust yourself&amp;#8221; - I never really interpreted this correctly and as a result, thought it was some closed minded and shitty advice; turns out I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#39;only_trusting_yourself_vs_trusting_yourself_to_judge_others&#39;&gt;Only trusting yourself vs. trusting yourself to judge others&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The really important differentiation here is between &amp;#8220;only trusting yourself&amp;#8221; (or more specifically, the implication of not trusting anyone else) and trusting your instincts (which I think is a much better way of putting this idea). Trusting your instincts is extremely important - sometimes they&amp;#8217;re wrong, but most of the time they aren&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#39;if_you_feel_deep_down_that_you_can_entrust_your_life_to_a_person_trust_your_own_judgement&#39;&gt;If you feel deep down that you can entrust your life to a person, trust your own judgement.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds ludicrous right? But really, if you don’t think you can rely on your own &lt;span&gt;seemingly rash&lt;/span&gt; judgement, how do you feel comfortable trusting anyone else’s judgement? It makes no sense. In the last 6 months or so I’ve rapidly become a much more confident person, much of this I attribute to trusting myself; there are more instances than I care to mention where I’ve acted upon someone else’s advice (in the past) in spite of my gut feeling being different, only to realise months (or years) later that I was right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#39;trust_yourself_take_risks_and_own_your_failures&#39;&gt;Trust yourself, take risks and own your failures&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds obvious and silly to the initiated, but I wish I had the sense to realise this a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;
